			Two hundred and seventeen years after Cole’s encounter, fresh sightings of the strange lunar bow (sometimes referred to by meteorologists as a ‘moonbow’) are once again in the news. A pair of ethereal photos captured recently in Yorkshire and in Northumberland have projected their luminous magic across social media this week, introducing Twitter and Facebook followers around the world to a heavenly phenomenon that many had previously never heard of, let alone seen.
			Generated in the same way that its more common cousin, the rainbow, is produced, a lunar bow occurs when light (this time reflected from the moon, rather than shining directly from the sun) is refracted through rain or mist suspended in the dimming atmosphere. Much more delicate in its fleeting projection than a rainbow, the lunar bow rarely conjures the full spectrum of colours and typically appears an icy white.
