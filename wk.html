				We started small, with a conversation with five women, sisters of our founder Victor. We asked them what they needed from us to change their own lives, and they described the businesses they wanted to launch or grow that would give them the resources to feed their families and send their children to school, a buffer of wealth against accidents and disease.

				This conversation was the origin of our pilot program. Women in the community who parter with us design and direct their own project or business, and we give them a small grant and provide financial support, feedback, and accountability. In return we ask that when they have successfully built their new income stream, they use some of their newfound freedom to support someone else in the community.
