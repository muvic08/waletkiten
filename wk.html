			Both eventualities are rather difficult to imagine, but we’ll all have to give them some thought sooner rather than later. Neuroscientist and neuroengineer Randal Koene thinks it’s only going to be another 10 years before we replace parts of the brain with prosthetics. From there, it’s just a matter of replacing each region systematically, to end up with someone whose brain is immortal and electronic. Could the last person to die have already been born?
			“My personal bet is yes,” Koene tells me. “Within 75 years we’ll be able to emulate an entire brain. I would very much like to be uploaded eventually. I hope I’ll achieve that. I’m already in my 40s, so we’ll have to get on with it quite quickly. But this isn’t about me. This is something very important that we all need to work on.”
			That’s because having your mind uploaded to a computer isn’t necessarily about the quest for eternal life. As a species which produces scientists and explorers, there’s going to be a point where we hit a ceiling of capability. Our fleshy hardware has limitations that will get in the way of our ambition, and, while the brain has been great at allowing our bodies to survive the threats of the savannah through millennia of hominid evolution, it was never designed specifically to master the complexities of global economics, to interface with super smart AIs of our own creation, and certainly not to travel through outer space.
